## Introduction

### Feeling of Mastery

It is important to know that players do not play a game because they have to, the play because they **enjoy** playing it. Thinking on optimal ways to engage the player is one of the most difficult things to do when creating a videogame but it is also key to guarantee its success. 

With Bosses we find exactly the same thing; players need reasons to fight a Boss.
