## Introduction


## What do boss battles mean to players?
### Feeling of Mastery
Boss fights have a unique feeling among all battles in videogame. They are distinct to normal battles in the sense that they do not aim to serve as learning tools or to test if the player can use new skills, they serve as **challenges to test** whether the player has mastered the previously learned skills in the game.

Thus, ideally, players should use all the things that they have learned previously to the boss during the battle and, when defeating it, they should feel like the really do master those skills.

**For example:** In "The Legend of Zelda", players obtains new skills in almost every new dungeon they visit. Since the very first moment they obtain that new skill, it is required to use it to go through the final steps of that dungeon. This progression culminates with the Boss fight, where that new skill is **absolutely key** in order to defeat the Boss. 

### Reasons
It is important to know that players do not play a game because they have to, the play because they **enjoy** playing it. Thinking on optimal ways to engage the player is one of the most difficult things to do when creating a videogame but it is also key to guarantee its success. 

With Bosses, we find exactly the same thing; players need reasons to fight a Boss. (Keep explaining)

Some of those reasons are:
   - **Loot:** 
   - **High Difficulty:**
   - **Unlocking next areas:**
   - **Plot-evolvers:**
   - **Emotional:**

## Types of Boss

Depending on their role, Bosses can be:
### Mini-Bosses

### Secondary Bosses
### Main Bosses
### Final Boss

### Design differences between them

## Designing a Boss
### Purpose
### Preparation
As mentioned when talking about the [Feeling of Mastery](https://github.com/kistofe/Boss-Design/blob/gh-pages/README.md#feeling-of-mastery), Bosses are like tests to the player to ensure they master a certain degree of skill. Knowing that, a Boss Fight should not be the moment to introduce new abilities or mechanics to players, as they would need to adapt to them during the fight itself. 

Instead, it is better to introduce those new abilities or mechanics during combats with regular enemies, as they are (generally) less punishing than boss fights, and then test the mastery of them in a Boss Fight.
