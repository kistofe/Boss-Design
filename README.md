## Introduction


## Types of Boss
Depending on their role, Bosses can be:

### Mini-Boss or Sub-Boss
They are not "Bosses" as we all know, but exceptionally strong enemies that tend to appear in the middle of a level. 

### Secondary Boss
### Main Boss
### Final Boss
The Final Boss of a videogame is also a kind of Main Boss. It differs from the rest in the fact that it generally appears more than once throughout the whole game, which creates a deeper relation with the player. Memorable  

### Design differences between them
## What do boss battles mean for players?
### Feeling of Mastery
Boss fights have a unique feeling among all battles in videogame. They are distinct to normal battles in the sense that they do not aim to serve as learning tools or to test if the player can use new skills, they serve as challenges to test whether the player has mastered the previously learned skills in the game or not.

Ideally, players should use all the things that they have learned previously to the boss during the battle and, when defeating it, they should feel like the really do master those skills.

**For example:** In "The Legend of Zelda", players obtain new skills in almost every new dungeon they visit. Since the very first moment they obtain that new skill, it is required to use it to go through the final steps of that dungeon. This progression culminates with the Boss fight, where that new skill is **absolutely key** in order to defeat the Boss.

### Reasons
It is important to know that players do not play a game because they have to, the play because they **enjoy** playing. Thinking on optimal ways to engage the player is one of the most difficult things to do when creating a videogame but it is also key to guarantee its success. 

With Bosses, we find exactly the same thing; players need reasons to fight a Boss, reasons that make them feel that they are not wasting their time. 

Here's a list of possible reasons you may base your Boss designs on:

   - **Loot:** Generally used in Secondary Bosses. As simple as "you defeat that big boss, you get this powerful weapon". Genres like MMOs are highly centered on this kind of Boss design.
   
   - **High Difficulty:** May not be liked by everyone, but an exceptional difficulty can be the only reason to fight a Secondary Boss, or can be an extra reason to prepare to fight a Main Boss.

   _Dark Souls is well-known for the difficulty of its Bosses, which has attracted more players to the game (Ornstein and Smough - Dark Souls, From Software(2011))_
     
   - **Unlocking next areas:** Which can be extra areas (in this case we are generally talking about Secondary Bosses) or areas according to the plot of the game (in this case, Main Bosses). 
      
   - **Plot-evolvers:** Exclusive for Main Bosses. As its name states, defeating these kind of Bosses makes the plot advance.  
      
   - **Emotional:** Can be used for both Secondary or Main Bosses. Players have some kind of personal link with the Boss that pushes them towards fighting it. A really good and clear example of these kind of Boss is **Red**, from Pokemon Silver/Gold/Crystal.

## Designing a Boss
Although there's nothing like a magic formula to create easily the perfect Boss, there exists some aspects that well merged can put you in a good spot to accomplish this difficult task. 


### Purpose
The first thing to have in mind when designing a Boss, is its _purpose_. This is probably one of the most important steps in the design process as we are basically creating the "pillars" on which the entire Boss Fight will be based. This process is divided in 3 steps. To illustrate them better, let's go one by one following an example from **"Hollow Knight" (Team Cherry, 2017)**.

- **List of the skill to test:** Bosses are like tests for players, so the first thing to think about is _what_ is going to be tested with this boss. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/iLNXFwb.png)   
_Let's say for example we want to test the jump mechanic of the main character._

- **List of attacks or challenges that will test that skill:** Now we have decided _what_ to test, we have to think _how_ to actually test it. In this step, it is recommended to think of those challenges independently to avoid limiting our ideas on the actual design of the boss.

_One of the False Knight's attacks is a heavy smash which sends out shockwaves. The player has to jump over them to avoid damage._

- **Adapt to the theme of the boss:** Now we have our designed attack, we have to adapt it to the actual aesthetic of the boss. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/SFOjytF.png)   
_How could a heavy smash to the ground be done? Why not trying with a giant mace?_

### Preparation
As mentioned when talking about the Feeling of Mastery section, Bosses are like tests to the player to ensure they master a certain degree of skill. Knowing that, a Boss Fight should not be the moment to introduce new abilities or mechanics to players, as they would need to adapt to them during the fight itself. 

Instead, it is better to introduce those new abilities or mechanics during combats with regular enemies, as they are (generally) less punishing than boss fights.

### Difficulty
Many designers, when creating their Bosses, ask themselves "How do I make my Boss challenging without overpowering it?". Well, to create a good difficulty curve for a Boss is not an easy task, but there are some things to take into account:

   - It should **adjust to the player's current state of development** in the game, in a natural way. It means that:
      - Bosses at first stages of the game should only challenge the basic mechanics of it, as it's all the player will have learned up to that moment. 
      - Bosses near middle stages should test the comprehension and usage of all learned abilities since that moment. 
      - Finally, Bosses near the final stages should not only test that, but also the optimal usage and the ability of the player to overcome the challenges presented during the fight by using those mastered skills. 
   - It should **stay faithful to the gameplay difficulty**; it has no sense to introduce an extremely difficult boss in a suitable for all audiences game.

   _The kind of Bosses in Super Mario Bros would feel out of place in a game like Super Meat Boy, known for its high difficulty. (New Super Mario Bros, Nintendo (2006)/ Super Meat Boy, Team Meat (2008))_
   
   - Althought it is not strictly mandatory, Main Bosses should increase, in terms of difficulty, throughout the game. In order to avoid making the player feel overwhelmed by a constantly increasing difficulty, Secondary and Mini Bosses can escape from this small rule and act as "rest" moments. 
   - Difficulty is not only reduced to increasing stats. Optimal difficulty comes from constant challenges. 
   

### Music and Sound
Music and Sound may sometimes go unnoticed by the player during the Boss Fight. However, this is not a reason not to put effort into creating a good audio to fit your Boss design. 

Music is a powerful tool to create feelings in the player. A good battle theme is the one that flows with the battle, the one that increases its pace when the battle does too, and decreases it when the battle slows down. Having a good design accompanied by a lack of music or a repetitive, generic one, can ruin all your efforts and turn, what should have been a good battle, into something dull. 

_Anyone who has ever played Final Fantasy can recognize [Sephiroth's theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7wJ8pE2qKU) just by listening a few seconds from it. Same applies with [San's theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcoqR9Bwx1Y), from 2015's Undertale._

However, having a great battle music is not enough if it is not appropriate to the theme of the boss or the game. The theme has to **fit** with the scene, or it will only give the sensation that the music is there because someone in the team liked it. 

The same applies with Sound effects. Having a big, heavy-looking Boss accompanied with non heavy-sounding sound effects may be confusing to the player. Be coherent with this!


### Visual Design
Bosses should stand out from any other kind of enemy on the map. They have to be easily recognizable by the player, as they will focus their attention on them.

Usually, what most designers tend to do is to make Bosses considerably bigger than regular enemies. This way, the player can distinguish it perfectly, and it also creates another interesting effect; the sense of facing something more powerful than you, something always present in the Hero's Tale.

### General mistakes when designing a boss

**More HP, more difficulty**  
One of the most extended mistakes when designing Bosses is to think that increasing the amount of HP they have, will instantly increase its difficulty. In some way, it does, but what we are doing here is creating **artificial difficulty**, which does not improve the gaming experience of the player in any sense.

Combats with this kind of bosses tend to result tedious and repetitive to the player, which is something designers should avoid. 


**Strange gimmicks not explained to the player**  
A classic mistake among unexperienced designers is to think that anything goes when talking about originality. When designing, in this case, a Boss, we all try to be different from the rest and try to come up with a great idea to blow up the players mind. This is a dangerous moment, because it is easy to jump from a good, original idea, into something completely the opposite. 

Introducing strange gimmicks during Boss battles without giving any hint to the player to overcome them, is not a good design flow. Players need to feel they are in control of the situation or, at least, that they have the tools to respond to unexpected moments. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/ODcsmJD.png)   
_Ruby Weapon, in Final Fantasy VII, is completely immune to damage unless you enter its battle with two of your team members dead. This, of course, is not even explained to the player inside the game. (Final Fantasy VII, Squaresoft (1999))_

**Randomness**   
Randomness can be a powerful tool, but also a dangerous one. It is used in party games to reduce the skill gap between players, as party games aim for the spontaneous fun and not for the correct skill development of the players. 

Randomness in videogames has always existed, but the incorrect use of it has a negative impact on the experience. Imagine an RPG Boss that each turn had a 50% chance to knock one of your team members down. Sounds funny? 

When fighting a Boss, players should feel like they can always win if they make the right decisions with the tools they have. Adding a high amount of randomness would break that feeling and would probably frustrate the player. 

**Breaking the Game rules**   
Breaking the Game rules means to do the opposite the player has been taught during the whole game. Let's directly jump to an example: Marie, the final Boss of the History Mode of **Skullgirls (Reverge Labs, 2012).**

![](https://i.imgur.com/1h2ue0T.jpg)   
_Marie, from Skullgirls._

All the previous fights to her, are regular fighting-game fights, where you learn the basics of the combat system. However, against her, none of that works; she can't be stunned, grabbed (not even by Blockbuster moves) or launched. Besides, She attacks from so many different ways at the same time, making it difficult to avoid, specially because some of those attacks require fast movement reaction, which not all the characters have. 

As Marie is basically static in the screen, the player can not predict her next move. All these elements, removed the strategy component  of the fight and turned it into a Heavy-attack-spam.

_Marie is not affected by hitstun and can throw atacks from so many different directions, making it almost impossible for the player to predict her._

It is important to keep in mind what your game rules are when designing a Boss, and to be faithful to them.  

## Boss Fight
### The "Pre-Boss" area
In order to build up before a Boss battle, designers often create a "Pre-Boss" area where the player can basically recover and prepare for what comes next. The player can "feel" when they will have to face a Boss because of certain elements of level design, like save points just before entering a new area, conveniently placed Health recoveries or Weapons or suspiciously large, empty rooms. 

These elements are small hints that reveal to the player that they will face a Boss in the next area. This preparation is a rewarding element for the player, as it prepares them for the fight and builds up their expectations. 

### The Fight
### Combat Stage
The combat stage is not only the physical place where the battle takes place, but also another element players can interact with. Traditionally, Bosses have been placed in large areas for two main reasons:
   - As in the visual design, it transmits to the player the feeling that they are facing something bigger than them, something special. 
   - It allows many different gameplay mechanics, which enriches the variety of the combat. An example of this gameplay mechanics could be to interact with specific elements in order to damage or weaken the Boss.

   _The fight agains Ceadeus in Monster Hunter Tri is in an ancient temple under water. There, the player can attack the monster with some powerful weapons located over the stage. (Monster Hunter Tri, Capcom (2009))_

Some games have given a twist to that traditional choice and have opted for smaller stages. Why? Because playing with space is a powerful tool to make boss fights interesting. Bosses like Onryoki, from Nioh, can almost reach every point in the stage with one of his attacks. The way to actually beat him, is to make precise and timed usage of the rolling mechanic. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/uhOJY9Z.png)   
_Onryoki's stage is considerably small. (Nioh, Team Ninja (2017)_

However, small stages can be a double-edged blade if there's no meaning on reducing it. If reducing the size of the stage creates the feeling in the player that the fight is "unfair" or "not well-thought", then you probably should think twice before doing it.

_The Capra Demon's stage is a well example of a bad execution of small stages. It is easy for the enemies to hit you just by entering and the entire fight is reduced to "exploit" the stairs. (Dark Souls, From Software (2009))_


### Post-Battle: Rewarding the player
Fighting the final Boss is the climax of the game, all the entire journey has taken place only for this moment. 

Defeating the Final Boss is a key moment in the gaming experience and players should feel like they really have achieved something out of normal. Specially with Final Bosses, players should see the result of all their effort in someway, so finishing the battle and seeing nothing more than a short cutscene would ruin all the greatness of the moment. 

Players want to know how their actions affected the world. What happened to the main characters? Is everything better know? Has nothing changed after the journey?
