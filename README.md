## Introduction


## Types of Boss
Depending on their role, Bosses can be:

### Mini-Boss or Sub-Boss
They are not "Bosses" as we all know, but exceptionally strong enemies that tend to appear in the middle of a level. 

### Secondary Boss
### Main Boss
### Final Boss
The Final Boss of a videogame is also a kind of Main Boss. It differs from the rest in the fact that it generally appears more than once throughout the whole game, which creates a deeper relation with the player. Memorable  

### Design differences between them
## What do boss battles mean for players?
### Feeling of Mastery
Boss fights have a unique feeling among all battles in videogame. They are distinct to normal battles in the sense that they do not aim to serve as learning tools or to test if the player can use new skills, they serve as challenges to test whether the player has mastered the previously learned skills in the game.

Ideally, players should use all the things that they have learned previously to the boss during the battle and, when defeating it, they should feel like the really do master those skills.

**For example:** In "The Legend of Zelda", players obtains new skills in almost every new dungeon they visit. Since the very first moment they obtain that new skill, it is required to use it to go through the final steps of that dungeon. This progression culminates with the Boss fight, where that new skill is **absolutely key** in order to defeat the Boss.

### Reasons
It is important to know that players do not play a game because they have to, the play because they **enjoy** playing. Thinking on optimal ways to engage the player is one of the most difficult things to do when creating a videogame but it is also key to guarantee its success. 

With Bosses, we find exactly the same thing; players need reasons to fight a Boss, reasons that make them feel that they are not wasting their time. 

Here's a list of possible reasons you may base your Boss designs on:

   - **Loot:** Generally used in Secondary Bosses. As simple as "you defeat that big boss, you get this powerful weapon". Genres like MMOs are highly centered on this kind of Boss design.  
   - **High Difficulty:** May not be liked by everyone, but an exceptional difficulty can be the only reason to fight a Secondary Boss, or can be an extra reason to prepare to fight a Main Boss. 
   - **Unlocking next areas:** 
   - **Plot-evolvers:** Exclusive for Main Bosses. As its name states, defeating these kind of Bosses makes the plot advance. 
   - **Emotional:** Can be used for both Secondary or Main Bosses. Players have some kind of personal link with the Boss that pushes them towards fighting it. A really good and clear example of these kind of Bosses is **Red**, from Pokemon Silver/Gold/Crystal.

This link has turned this optional fight into something almost mandatory to any Pokemon fan. (Image from "Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal, Nintendo (1999-2001))_

## Designing a Boss
Although there's nothing like a magic formula to create easily the perfect Boss, there exists some aspects that well merged can put you in a good spot in this difficult task. 


### Purpose
The first thing to have in mind when designing a Boss, is its _purpose_. This is probably one of the most important steps in the design process as we are basically creating the "pillars" on which the entire Boss Fight will be based. This process is divided in 3 steps. To illustrate them better, let's go one by one following an example from **"Hollow Knight" (Team Cherry, 2017)**.

1. **List of the skill to test:** Bosses are like tests for players, so the first thing to think about is _what_ is going to be tested with this boss. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/iLNXFwb.png)

_Let's say for example we want to test the jump mechanic of the main character._


2. **List of attacks or challenges that will test that skill:** Now we have decided _what_ to test, we have to think _how_ to actually test it. In this step, it is recommended to think of those challenges independently to avoid limiting our ideas on the actual design of the boss.

_One of the False Knight's attacks is a heavy smash which sends out shockwaves. The player has to jump over them to avoid damage._


3. **Adapt to the theme of the boss:** Now we have our designed attack, we have to adapt it to the actual aesthetic of the boss.

_How could a heavy smash to the ground be done? Why not trying with a giant mace?_

### Preparation
As mentioned when talking about the [Feeling of Mastery](https://github.com/kistofe/Boss-Design/blob/gh-pages/README.md#feeling-of-mastery), Bosses are like tests to the player to ensure they master a certain degree of skill. Knowing that, a Boss Fight should not be the moment to introduce new abilities or mechanics to players, as they would need to adapt to them during the fight itself. 

Instead, it is better to introduce those new abilities or mechanics during combats with regular enemies, as they are (generally) less punishing than boss fights.
